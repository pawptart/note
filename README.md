# note

Note is a note-taking application built in React as a part of a project for Vanderbilt University's Coding Bootcamp.

Note's frontend is coded in React but uses API calls to a Ruby on Rails app in order to store note data.

### Some things *note* can do:

* Create, edit, and delete notes
* Create and delete custom tags for each note
* Store notes in a database

Note uses the [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) to simplify API calls to the database.
